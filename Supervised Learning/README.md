# Supervised model

----

For our supervised model we used a pre-trained VGG16 from [Keras.Applications](https://keras.io/api/applications/)

You can see how we trained the model in the notebook `train_model.ipynb`. 

To adapt this, we also recommend you to have a look at [Tensorflow - Transfer learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning)

We used the following Grad-Cam implementation: [Grad-CAM class activation visualization](https://keras.io/examples/vision/grad_cam/)
