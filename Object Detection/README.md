# Object Detection
----
For the implementation of our object detection model we followed [tensorflows object detection api](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

We used a CenterNet HourGlass104 512x512 from [tensorflow model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)

For the annotation we used [LabelImg](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg)
